# Solar-System
This hypothetical model of the Solar System, where all the planets are revolving around the Sun in elliptical orbits with the same starting point, consists of the Sun, Halley's Comet, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and, Neptune. 
The planet Neptune, the Asteroid belt, the Oort cloud, and other dwarf planets inside the Kuiper belt are not shown for the sake of ease of visualization. 
Although it is shown here that Earth does 4 revolutions per Neptune's revolution around the Sun, it is not true. The periods of revolutions of planets around the Sun are not exact to reduce the time complexity of the program.
